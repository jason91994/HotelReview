Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.                                                                                         </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Amazing Property and Experience         </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>        </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ron       </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/%25252525253Flocale%25252525253Den_US%252525252526pos%25252525253DHCOM_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Sweet sweet serenity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/\\%25252525253Flocale\\%25252525253Den\\_US\\%252525252526pos\\%25252525253DHCOM\\_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa\\_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews\\%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                         & http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

       & We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience.

Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well.

Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3 We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.\n",

Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant.

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \n",

I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay! \n",

Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat. A gem in chicago... \n",

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of \\$100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \n",

I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay! \n",

Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat. A gem in chicago... \n",

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \n",

I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay! \n",

       "1 We stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday. Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat.

       "3 This comes a little late as I'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months:) A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n\n",
       "4 The Omni Chicago really delivers on all fronts, from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on Michigan Avenue. While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "5 I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got. The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order.

       "6 I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel. I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay! \\n                                                             "

Can't wait to go back.                                                                                                                                                                                            </span>                                                 </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Sweet sweet serenity                    </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>        </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>D         </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/%25252525253Flocale%25252525253Den_US%252525252526pos%25252525253DHCOM_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.                                                                                         </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Amazing Property and Experience         </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>        </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ron       </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/%25252525253Flocale%25252525253Den_US%252525252526pos%25252525253DHCOM_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Sweet sweet serenity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/\\%25252525253Flocale\\%25252525253Den\\_US\\%252525252526pos\\%25252525253DHCOM\\_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa\\_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews\\%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                         & http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

       & We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.                                                                  & Amazing Property and Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & Ron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/\\%25252525253Flocale\\%25252525253Den\\_US\\%252525252526pos\\%25252525253DHCOM\\_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa\\_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews\\%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                         & http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Sweet sweet serenity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/%25252525253Flocale%25252525253Den_US%252525252526pos%25252525253DHCOM_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                         | http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.                                                  | Amazing Property and Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Ron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | http://www.hotels.com/ho125419/%25252525253Flocale%25252525253Den_US%252525252526pos%25252525253DHCOM_US,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/rancho-valencia-resort-and-spa_1895174051.html,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/125419/reviews%20/,https://foursquare.com/v/rancho-valencia-resort--spa/4aaedb79f964a5208f6320e3,http://www.gayot.com/Hotels/Select-Your-City/United-States/California/San-Diego/Rancho-Valencia-Resort-Spa-Rancho-Santa-Fe-SDHOT02319-02                                                                         | http://www.ranchovalencia.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | deceptive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.\n",
